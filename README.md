Welcome to the Collaboration Repository for the Model Based Enterprise (MBE) Demonstrator Reference Model (RM) activity supporting Aerospace need across the industry standards activity. These models (Native CAD, STEP Models, and other data) are in support of goals for LOTAR and ISO. They also should be considered for other groups: ![AFNeT](http://www.afnet.fr/), ![PDES, Inc.](http://www.pdesinc.org/), and ![prostep ivip](http://www.prostep.org/en/). 

We will develop a plan for 2022 enhancments of the MBE Demonstrator RM that will comprise version 1.2.

The purpose of this platform is to demonstrate standards based digital twin.

A tree of the current files and folder is located and is built using the following command:
tree /f | tee MBD-Demonstrator-RM.txt
